Bubble Sort was found to be the slowest of the simple sorting algorthems. Selection sort  
and Insertion sort where both improvements on bubble but in terms of each other, the execution   
time was roughly the same. Depending on how already sorted the array is, if an array is already    
partially sorted, Insertion Sort can be qucker then then selection Sort  
  
Bubble Sort O(n^2)  
Selection Sort O(n^2)  
Insertion Sort O(n^2)

Bubble Sort is simple but slow, Why is Bubble is so slow is because it's swapping every time  
it finds adjacent numbers out of order  
  
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Best-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)

The selection sort is an improvement on bubble sort by making only one exchange for every   
pass through the list.  
  
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Best-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)

Insertion is improvement on bubble and selection, Instead of swapping slide/shift the array  
until an INSERT position is found.  
  
Best-case performance 	O(n)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)   
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)
